## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` which sets `composite: true`. The root `tsconfig.json` lists all packages as project references.

## Root Scripts

- `pnpm run build` — runs `typecheck` first, then recursively runs `build` in all packages
- `pnpm run typecheck` — runs `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly` using project references

## Packages

### `artifacts/from-the-ground-up` (`@workspace/from-the-ground-up`)

React + Vite nonprofit website with 8 pages. Uses wouter for routing, TanStack React Query for data fetching, Framer Motion for animations, and react-hook-form for forms.

### `artifacts/api-server` (`@workspace/api-server`)

Express 5 API server with routes for programs, contacts, and testimonials.

### `lib/db` (`@workspace/db`)

Database layer with Drizzle ORM schemas for programs, contacts, and testimonials tables.

### `lib/api-spec` (`@workspace/api-spec`)

OpenAPI 3.1 spec and Orval codegen config.

### `scripts` (`@workspace/scripts`)

Utility scripts including `seed` to populate initial program and testimonial data.

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed` — seeds the database with programs and testimonials

Production migrations are handled by Replit when publishing. In development, use `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`.
